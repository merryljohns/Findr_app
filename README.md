Findr 🔎

A Smart Lost, Found & Resell Platform for Campus Communities

Project Description

Findr is a campus-focused lost, found, and resell platform designed to improve communication about misplaced or reusable items within a college environment.

Currently, lost-and-found communication happens mostly through WhatsApp groups, where posts often get ignored, buried, or missed. Findr replaces this unreliable system with a structured, searchable, and interactive platform built specifically for students.

The app allows users to post lost items, report found items, sell second-hand goods, chat with item owners in real time, and receive automatic match suggestions based on descriptions.
